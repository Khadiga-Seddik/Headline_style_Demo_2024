6a408c50ec44c8ef78b7037f9ca21622;The remarkable humanity of Joe Biden;"Any time the subject of Joe Biden comes up, the first question people always ask is: What do people see in this guy? <br><br> Inherent in that question is the caricature of Biden that has come to be how most people who don't follow politics closely ""know"" the vice president. He's the guy who says the wrong stuff at all the wrong times, goofs around even during the State of the Union address and seems not to totally grasp the line between personal and professional. <br><br> And, yes, Biden is all of those things. But the death of his son — former Delaware state attorney general Beau Biden — over the weekend at the age of 46 reminded me of the thing Biden is above all else: startlingly human. <br><br> Most politicians in the modern age are sort of like a new product — such as a new car. They've been focus-grouped to within an inch of their life. They are sold, literally, to the public in the most consumer-friendly way possible, with all traces of the awkward, uncomfortable or unpleasant totally washed away. <br><br> Of course, as everyone knows, those tough bits are the stuff that builds character and makes us who we are. Obscuring that stuff for fear of ""how it will play"" is, ultimately doing a giant disservice to the voters who are trying to understand who these people running to represent them really are. Who they were before they became ""senator"" or ""governor"" or whatever. <br><br> Joe Biden got into politics in a different age. He simply would never have succeeded in the ""he said what?!"" politics of today — as evidenced by his flop of a 2008 presidential bid, a candidacy defined by his referring to then-Sen. Barack Obama as ""clean"" and ""articulate"" on the first day he was formally a candidate. <br><br> Biden never had the rough parts of his personality polished away. The rough parts were, in many ways, who he was. And yes, that fact got him into plenty of trouble over the years and almost certainly ensured that he would never reach his ultimate goal of being president. And yet, the fact that Biden's personality never got scrubbed of its distinctiveness is also his greatest asset: He is as close to a real person as you will ever find in an office like the one he holds. (If you have not read Jeanne Marie Laskas's Biden profile in the July 2013 GQ, you should really do it.) <br><br> It's that wear-it-on-your-sleeve humanness that, I think, has made the death of Beau Biden affecting for so many. (As the father of two young boys, it's hit me hard.) Because Joe Biden isn't some distant political figure; he's Uncle Joe, the guy who, whether you like it or not, would probably ruffle your hair and ask you how your grandma is doing if you ever met him. You feel like you know him — and that's because he feels like someone you DO know. How many politicians can you say that about? <br><br> None of the above excuses some of Biden's behavior or makes him an ideal candidate to be president. But for all the negative coverage his all-too-humanness gets, it's worth remembering the positive side of that unique set of personality traits, too. <br><br> Biden's humanity — forged in grief — allows him to connect with people because he allows them to see the dark parts of him — never more so than in his commencement speech at Yale University a few weeks back.  Here's Biden from that speech: <br><br> The most successful and happiest people I’ve known understand that a good life at its core is about being personal.  It’s about being engaged. It’s about being there for a friend or a colleague when they're injured or in an accident, remembering the birthdays, congratulating them on their marriage, celebrating the birth of their child. It’s about being available to them when they're going through personal loss. It’s about loving someone more than yourself, as one of your speakers have already mentioned. It all seems to get down to being personal. <br><br> That's Joe Biden. Remarkably personal. And remarkably human. <br><br>";Chris Cillizza;10:10:31;2015-06-01;https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2015-05-30/Reuters/2015-05-31T021252Z_01_TOR433_RTRIDSP_3_USA-BIDEN-SON.jpg;Joe Biden hugs his son Beau, who introduced him at the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colo., on Aug. 27, 2008.

b62a6ae1b8c15453f1e81c561528cc54;Lucas Giolito recalled to start Sunday, Wilmer Difo optioned to Class AA Harrisburg;As expected, and as required by major league rules given that he was scheduled to start a few hours later, the Nationals recalled Lucas Giolito from Class AAA Syracuse Sunday morning. To make room, they optioned infielder Wilmer Difo to Class AA Harrisburg, a somewhat unorthodox pitcher-for-position player switch made necessary by injuries and major league rules regarding call-ups. <br><br> Rosters expand Sept. 1, meaning the Nationals can bring up any player on their 40-man roster without conforming to the usual 25-man allotment. But the rule that requires a player to remain in the minor leagues 10 days after being sent down still applies — at least until the team a player is optioned to finishes its schedule. The Chiefs and Senators end their season on Monday, Sept. 5, so Difo will be eligible to come back after that. <br><br> The Nationals might have chosen to option A.J. Cole out after his start Saturday and maintain their pitcher-to-position player ratio, then called up a different young starter like they did at other times this season. But with Giolito starting Sunday, the likeliest replacement would have been rookie Reynaldo Lopez. Lopez was sent down Thursday when the Nationals acquired relief pitcher Marc Rzepczynski, and therefore cannot return until his 10 days are up next weekend in New York — after that spot in the rotation comes around again. <br><br> Cole, therefore, will stay. Difo goes back from whence he came, Harrisburg, for 10 days before he can be called up for the rest of September, too. The Nationals will play with a short bench until they option out another pitcher — a bench consisting of Clint Robinson, Chris Heisey, Jose Lobaton and Ben Revere — though Revere is in Sunday’s starting lineup to give Jayson Werth a day off. <br><br> Revere will play left field, while Trea Turner stays in center. Everyone else is back in there after the 11-inning loss Saturday, including catcher Wilson Ramos. Ramos will catch Giolito, who is making his fourth major league start. He has pitched 11 innings combined and is working to a 4.91 ERA. <br><br> LINEUPS <br><br> NATIONALS Turner CF Revere LF Murphy 2B Harper RF Rendon 3B Ramos C Zimmerman 1B Espinosa SS Giolito P <br><br> ROCKIES Blackmon CF LeMahieu 2B Gonzalez RF Arenado 3B Dahl LF Parra 1B Descalso SS Wolters C Bettis P <br><br>;Metaphor manipulated headline;10:37:24;2016-08-28;https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/07/08/Production/Daily/Sports/Images/545408762.jpg;Lucas Giolito struggled in his two most recent big league starts, and gets his fourth Sunday.

57ac88b8-8f80-11e5-ae1f-af46b7df8483;Obama takes immigration leniency plan to the Supreme Court;"The Obama administration asked the Supreme Court on Friday to overturn lower courts and declare that the president has the authority to allow millions of illegal immigrants to remain and work in the United States without fear of deportation. <br><br> The administration petitioned the justices to step in only 10 days after a federal appeals court ruled against President Obama’s program. Unless the Supreme Court agrees to consider the issue and overrules the lower court, Obama has little chance of carrying out the program before he leaves office in January 2017. <br><br> The case raises major issues involving the separation of powers and federalism. The issue has flummoxed Congress and emerged as one of the major flash points of disagreement between the Democrats and Republicans running for president. <br><br> Obama announced the program in an executive order exactly a year ago Friday after House Republicans blocked an effort to pass a comprehensive immigration bill. <br><br> Texas and 25 other states sued, saying that Obama had exceeded his authority with a plan that would allow between 4 million to 5 million illegal immigrants to remain in this country. <br><br> The administration contends that the states have no legal standing to sue because it is up to the federal government to set immigration policy and that the Department of Homeland Security did not violate federal statutes in devising the program. <br><br> As a practical matter, the government says setting priorities about whom to deport is a practical response to the fact that Congress has given the administration only enough money to deport no more than about 400,000 of the nation’s estimated 11 million illegal immigrants. <br><br> Obama’s program, called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA), would allow illegal immigrants in those categories to remain in the country and apply for work permits if they have been here for at least five years and have not committed felonies or repeated misdemeanors. <br><br> The administration says the program is simply a form of prioritizing which illegal immigrants the government will move first to deport. <br><br> In his petition, U.S. Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. said the appeals court had blocked “a federal immigration enforcement policy of great national importance, and has done so in violation of established limits on the judicial power. If left undisturbed, that ruling will allow states to frustrate the federal government’s enforcement of the nation’s immigration laws.” <br><br> Verrilli said that lower court ruling “will force millions of people — who are not removal priorities under criteria the court conceded are valid, and who are parents of U.S. citizens and permanent residents — to continue to work off the books, without the option of lawful employment to provide for their families. And it will place a cloud over the lives of hundreds of thousands of people who came to the United States as children, have lived here for years, and been accorded deferred action.” <br><br> But the states have said Obama’s program is an illegal power grab by the president, initiating on his own a program that Congress would not authorize. <br><br> Texas and others said the plan runs afoul of federal laws and saddles states with providing benefits for millions of people who would become eligible for work permits and other forms of government aid. <br><br> “Three times federal courts have ruled in our favor, and we stand ready to continue defending the rule of law against the president’s unconstitutional use of executive power,” said Cynthia Meyer, a spokeswoman for Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R). <br><br> A federal district court and then two panels of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit in New Orleans agreed with the states’ arguments. Both courts have kept the program from being implemented. <br><br> In the most recent decision, U.S. Circuit Judge Jerry Smith wrote that DAPA goes beyond the law enforcement concept of “prosecutorial discretion,” in which a government with limited resources sets priorities for enforcement. <br><br> “Deferred action . . . is much more than nonenforcement: It would affirmatively confer ‘lawful presence’ and associated benefits on a class of unlawfully present aliens,” he said. “Though revocable, that change in designation would trigger” eligibility for federal and state benefits “that would not otherwise be available to illegal aliens.” <br><br> Smith was joined by Circuit Judge Jennifer Walker Elrod. <br><br> Circuit Judge Carolyn Dineen King dissented. She said the program was exactly the kind of decision about deportation that the law entrusts to the executive branch. Those eligible for the program must apply, and decisions are made on a case-by-case basis, she said. <br><br> “Both ‘lawful presence’ and ‘deferred action’ refer to nothing more than DHS’s tentative decision, revocable at any time, not to remove an individual for the time being — i.e., the decision to exercise prosecutorial discretion,” she wrote. <br><br> She added: “The policy decisions at issue in this case are best resolved not by judicial fiat, but via the political process. . . . This case essentially boils down to a policy dispute.” <br><br> King also criticized her colleagues for delaying the decision; the ruling saying the law could not proceed took four months. <br><br> Time is critical if the Supreme Court is to review the matter while the Obama administration remains in office. <br><br> Generally, the court must accept a case by January to schedule it for oral arguments and a decision before the court’s term ends in June. Verrilli’s filing Friday starts a process that would allow the court, absent any delays, to do just that. <br><br> But experts on the court note that the justices could also make special accommodations for a case that carries such important questions about federalism and the balance of power between the political branches of government. <br><br> If the court accepts the case, the decision would come just months before Americans go to the polls to elect a new president. <br><br> It would be adding to a docket filled with election-year controversies: a review of abortion restrictions passed by the states, whether universities may consider race when making admission decisions, and whether religious freedom means that some organizations do not have to comply with a mandate in the Affordable Care Act requiring insurance coverage of contraceptives for women. <br><br> Verrilli’s petition relies heavily on a 2012 Supreme Court decision that struck down parts of an Arizona law restricting immigration and said “the removal process is entrusted to the discretion of the federal government.” <br><br> The administration challenges the lower court’s findings that Texas had legal standing to sue because DAPA’s designation that the immigrants would be legally present in this country meant they would be entitled to state driver’s licenses. The petition said that was because of Texas’s rules, not anything that is in the president’s order. <br><br> Verrilli also disputed the lower court’s ruling that the DHS secretary had exceeded his authority in issuing “guidance” about how to treat the illegal immigrants. <br><br> Under the appeals court’s reasoning, Verrilli said, immigration statutes allow the secretary to decide that individuals may remain in the country for a period of time “but is barred from enabling them to work lawfully to support themselves and their families while they are here. Congress did not constrain the secretary’s broad discretion to such half-measures.” <br><br> The case is United States v. Texas. <br><br>";Metaphor manipulated headline;09:23:59;2015-11-20;https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/11/20/National-Politics/Images/Was8980697-3593.jpg; (Karen Bleier/AFP/Getty Images) <br><br>;Robert Barnes has been a Washington Post reporter and editor since 1987.

8fb63ab77d0b3addab945f458d96f5ec;There’s a war on between Amazon and its suppliers, but which side should you root for?;"Weeks after we learned that Amazon.com stopped taking preorders for books published by Hachette, the online retailer has now put the kibosh on advance orders for coming Warner Home Video products like ""The Lego Movie."" <br><br> The move pits Amazon against a different content industry, but the underlying business logic is the same: Amazon wants to pay the supplier less for products, and the supplier wants Amazon to pay more. This kind of negotiation happens all the time, but Amazon's talks are drawing attention because of the dominant role it plays in getting us the stuff we buy. <br><br> (Disclosure: Amazon.com chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.) <br><br> Amazon says its hardball tactics are meant to secure a better deal for you and me. Others are calling Amazon a bully for punishing content providers simply for trying to get fairly compensated. <br><br> If you're having trouble picking a side, don't feel bad. This is a complicated issue. <br><br> On the face of it, Amazon appears to be using its substantial leverage as a seller to extract huge concessions from suppliers. Let's just take the book publishing industry. Amazon effectively gets a 53 percent discount on all Random House titles. Kindle e-books account for a fifth of the entire U.S. book market, and within the e-book sector specifically, Amazon enjoys a two-thirds lock. If you're a publisher, you can't not sell on Amazon. Amazon knows this, and has an incentive to demand that publishers bend over backwards to accommodate the company. <br><br> That said, Amazon has also vastly expanded the overall market for books more generally. The novelist Barry Eisler defended the company earlier this month, arguing that Amazon has empowered legions of self-published authors. Small publishers who previously had trouble competing against the so-called Big Five report having benefited from the more level playing field that the Amazon platform provides. <br><br> Publishers themselves aren't exactly put-upon or defenseless, either. Consumers have long complained about the power of academic publishers to increase textbook prices, for instance. Literary agents have called out publishers for giving authors a raw deal. And most recently, in a controversial court case involving Apple, publishers were found to have acted like a cartel in trying to raise margins on e-books. <br><br> Of course, the publishers might say this whole sticky court case could've been avoided if only Amazon hadn't tried to sell e-books at such a low price. And the online retailer's habit of selling e-books below cost as a way to encourage Kindle adoption certainly fits into a much longer narrative about its stormy relationship with publishers. <br><br> Unfortunately, none of this helps consumers who just want somebody to take their money. <br><br>";Metaphor manipulated headline;12:25:58;2014-06-11;https://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/files/2014/06/5145996668_1821ed9eba_z.jpg;(Kodomut) <br><br>;Brian Fung covers technology for The Washington Post, focusing on telecommunications, Internet access and the shifting media economy.

495ff82f1577c971aa7ae0b6fbbc2673;2013 has been a very good year for Chris Christie. And it’s going to get better.;"No one weighing a run for the Republican presidential nomination has had a better year than Chris Christie -- and it's about to get better. <br><br> Christie is widely expected to roll up a massive victory in his reelection bid on Nov. 5 in New Jersey, a win in a blue state that will form the foundation of the argument for his now-expected run for president in 2016. <br><br> It's the latest piece of good news for Christie in the first 10 1/2 months of 2013. Consider: <br><br> * As congressional Republicans feuded among themselves in the early days of the year over allocating federal funds to benefit the victims -- many of whom were in New Jersey -- of Hurricane Sandy, Christie went ballistic, savaging his party and its leaders. ""There is only one group to blame for the continued suffering of these innocent victims,” Christie thundered. “The House majority and their speaker, John Boehner.”  <br><br> * In a speech to the Republican National Committee in August, Christie made very clear that his priority in politics was winning. That was also his second and third priority. He derided ""folks who believe that our job is to be college professors,” adding: “If we don’t win, we don’t govern. And if we don’t govern, all we do is shout to the wind. And so I am going to do anything I need to do to win.”  The Republican political class (silently) cheered that line of thinking, as did many of the party's mega-donors who prize pragmatism over strict adherence to core principles and, oh by the way, provide the seed money for presidential candidates. <br><br> * The national political story line for much of the summer and fall has been dominated by the government shutdown, the debt-ceiling debate and the general malaise directed at Washington from the electorate.  Christie, as a governor, steered clear of much of that mess -- telling CBS in the days leading up to the shutdown that ""I think it's always irresponsible if you're running the government to be advocating for shutting it down. That by definition is a failure. You gotta work it out."" <br><br> The year in Republican politics then has been defined by two interrelated narrative strains: (1) The civil war within the party between mathematicians and priests and (2) The disgust -- among independents and even many Republicans -- about how Washington is being run and ""working."" <br><br> In the civil war within the party, Christie has emerged as the standard-bearer of the practical/mathematician wing in 2013. Perhaps the clearest example of that fact came earlier this week when he announced that he would not appeal a state Supreme Court ruling that affirmed the legality of gay marriage in the Garden State. (Christie had previously vetoed a bill legalizing gay marriage that was passed through the Democratic-controlled legislature.)  In explaining his decision to walk away from the court fight, Christie's administration said he didn't see a point in charging at a political windmill. That's a stark contrast to the fight over the past month or so in Washington, where a bloc of Republicans led by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz helped to force a government shutdown under the (mistaken) belief that they could extract concessions from the White House on President Obama's health-care law. <br><br> When it comes to Washington being broken, Christie, too, has benefited mightily. His political brand, almost since the moment he was elected in 2009, has been as the tough-talking (some of his critics would say bullying) outsider who tells it how it is, party politics be damned. That brand can get him into trouble (see: his praise of Obama's handling of Hurricane Sandy during the final days of the 2012 campaign), but, by and large, it is the thing that distinguishes him from the crowd. <br><br> Given that, it's hard to imagine 2013 working out better for Christie in terms of the political machinations in Washington. While Republicans in D.C. are obsessed with filibusters and parliamentary procedures, Christie is making executive decisions and rolling up a massive reelection win in a state that Republicans haven't won at the presidential level since 1988.  Having ""senator"" or ""representative"" before your name is almost always a bad thing in presidential politics (Barack Obama was the first senator elected directly from that chamber to the presidency since John F. Kennedy in 1960), but it's an even worse thing when everyone hates Washington -- like right now. <br><br> All of the above is not to say that Christie won't have real problems -- particularly with the GOP's tea party base -- when (whoops, if) he runs for president in 2016.  Christie's blunt talk and focusing on ""winning > principled losses"" will turn off many Republicans who believe the reason they don't control the White House (and haven't since 2008) is because the party nominated two insufficiently conservative candidates in '08 and 2012.  But, in truth, Christie was never going to be the tea party candidate in the field. That will be a fight between Cruz and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul. <br><br> What Christie has done in 2013 is position himself as the go-to candidate for voters (and donors) who think the single most important thing in 2016 is nominating a candidate who can win the White House, not win an ideological battle.  Christie is their guy now.  That can -- of course -- change, and might if someone like Jeb Bush decides to run. But, at the moment, Christie is at the top of that heap, which, despite all of the changes happening within the Republican Party, is a very good place to be. <br><br>";Metaphor manipulated headline;12:29:58;2013-10-23;https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2013-10-22/AP/Gay_Marriage_NJ-0faf9.jpg;New Jersey Gov.

61a23f15e68f01a5cbbd29dc7589570b;Rand Paul is the most interesting man in the (political) world;"The first six months of 2013 have made two things very clear: 1) Rand Paul is running for president and 2) Rand Paul is the most interesting politician in the country at the moment. <br><br> From his filibuster over drones to his positioning on the immigration reform bill to his well-received trips to early presidential-voting states, Paul has shown a knack for simultaneously confounding expectations and drawing press attention. And, with the immigration fight in the Senate headed to a conclusion in the next few weeks and the debt ceiling battle looming this fall, Paul promises to be at the center of the political conversation going forward, too. <br><br> ""Rand wants to accomplish things, not merely blow up the process in order to make news,"" said Billy Piper, former chief of staff to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. ""That is refreshing and I think helps explain why so many on the right have been drawn to his leadership and style."" <br><br> (Make sure to read Julia Ioffe's Rand profile in the new edition of the New Republic.) <br><br> Paul is, without question, a prime mover in two arenas right now: the Senate and the presidential race. (Of course, the Senate is also a proving ground/minefield for several members of the 2016 presidential field so the two arenas are deeply intertwined.) <br><br> Paul's filibuster of CIA director John Brennan's nomination earlier this year proves his power in both spaces. Not only did Paul demonstrate his status as the first among equals with the tea party-aligned crowd that includes the likes of Ted Cruz (Texas) and Mike Lee (Utah) but he also showed that he acts and other 2016ers react. That includes Marco Rubio (Fla.), the man most Republicans regard as the frontrunner for the GOP presidential nomination, who went to the floor to support Paul's filibuster (and to make sure there wasn't much rhetorical space between he and the senator from Kentucky when it came to criticizing the Obama Administration). <br><br> ""No 2016er has helped himself more than Rand Paul in last 8 months,"" said one senior Republican operative granted anonymity to speak candidly about the 2016 field.  ""He has methodically put himself on track to being serious contender for GOP nomination in 2016. If the next 18 months are similar to the last couple, his presidential campaign will be much different than his father's."" <br><br> What Republicans -- establishment-types and others -- find most intriguing about Paul is his potential to appeal in directions and demographics (civil libertarians, young people etc.) that get the party beyond the coalition built by Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. (We've written lots of late on the growing libertarian strain in the country and Paul is the elected official most closely aligned with those views.) <br><br> Here's Paul describing his vision of a new Republican party in an interview last month with Spencer Ackerman: ""The way we’re going to compete is by running people for office who can appreciate some issues that attract young people and independents: civil liberties, as well as a less aggressive foreign policy, not putting people in jail for marijuana, a much more tolerant type of point of view."" <br><br> And here's a veteran Senate political operative on Paul's potential appeal: ""Rand is the first real candidate in thirty years with the potential to alter Reagan's three-legged stool of defense hawks, fiscal conservatives, and social conservatives. He really has a modern appeal that has a much higher ceiling with today's electorate than anyone else in the party right now."" <br><br> Whether Rand Paul winds up as a top-tier presidential candidate in 2016 -- we think he will be -- it's clear he is someone who has not only avoided being pigeonholed on any one issue but also leapt over the expectations many people had for him when he was first elected in 2010. <br><br> ""He has continually been underestimated politically over the past four years and easily crossed the bar each time,"" said Jon Deuser, a longtime Republican consultant with Kentucky ties. ""I think he fascinates us because he is so un-Washington and doesn't easily fit into the usual left-right cubby holes."" <br><br> Here's where Paul fits at the moment: he is the most interesting person in the Republican political world.  And that's a good place to be. <br><br>";Forward reference manipulated headline;12:45:43;2013-06-18;https://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/files/2013/06/Rand.jpg;Senator Rand Paul continues to fascinate.

be5a3bc8-d59f-11e4-a62f-ee745911a4ff;2015 NCAA tournament: As Maryland women get set for Elite Eight, Terps’ Lexie Brown has fond memories rooting for Tennessee;SPOKANE, Wash. —  Maryland point guard Lexie Brown grew up in Florida and played high school basketball in Georgia, so as a youth in Southeastern Conference country, the sophomore couldn’t help but admire the tradition-rich Tennessee women’s program. She even attended the Lady Vols’ most recent Final Four appearance in 2008 in Tampa. <br><br> Seven years later, Tennessee is the last opponent between the top-seeded Terrapins and a second straight trip to the Final Four, which, coincidentally, will be contested at the same arena where Brown witnessed the Lady Vols topple Stanford, 64-48, to win their then-NCAA record eighth national championship. <br><br> Maryland (33-2) advanced to Monday night’s Spokane Region final with a 65-55 victory over former ACC rival Duke on Saturday afternoon. No. 2 seed Tennessee (30-5) erased a 17-point deficit with 6 minutes 34 seconds left in regulation to force overtime and emerge with a 73-69 win against 11th-seeded Gonzaga, the hometown favorite with fervent support at Spokane Arena. <br><br> “I definitely grew up a fan of Pat Summitt and her program,” Brown said of college basketball’s career leader in coaching wins, men or women. “I’ve always been a fan of Tennessee. I’ve never really wanted to go there, but I’ve always been appreciative of what Pat Summitt brought to our sport. Last year to be able to play a team like that, it was a lot of fun. It was really cool to be able to play against the legendary Tennessee Lady Vols.” <br><br> Brown was referring to a 73-62 win against Tennessee in the 2014 Louisville Region semifinals in which she had 14 points, five steals and two rebounds on the way to being selected first-team all region. Maryland was the No. 4 seed last season while the Lady Vols were the top seed, and the Terrapins relished their underdog status in reaching the Final Four in Nashville. <br><br> This time Maryland is bracing for an emotionally charged adversary not only supremely confident following one of the NCAA tournament’s most improbable comebacks but also playing with extra fire for an ailing Hall of Fame coach who no longer roams the sideline. <br><br> Summitt coached Tennessee for 38 seasons and compiled 1,098 wins until her retirement in 2012 because of early onset dementia diagnosed four years ago. <br><br> During Saturday’s region semifinal, Lady Vols supporters waved signs that read, “Win for Pat.” The rest of the SEC was on board this season too, with all its women’s basketball teams wearing “We Back Pat” T-shirts from Jan. 18 through Jan. 26. Tennessee also hosts an annual “We Back Pat” game intended to heighten awareness about Alzheimer’s and raise funds through the Pat Summitt Foundation. <br><br> Only a handful of Lady Vols recruited by Summitt remain, all of them seniors, including point guard Ariel Massengale and forward Cierra Burdick, who had 22 points and 15 rebounds in the region semifinals. Senior center Isabelle Harrison, a projected lottery pick in the WNBA draft, tore her anterior cruciate ligament in February and is out for the rest of the season. <br><br> “When you lose a head coach that you want to play for the stature of Pat, they have been through a lot,” Tennessee Coach Holly Warlick, formerly Summitt’s top assistant, said of her seniors. “Then they have been very accepting of me and positive, so I think that they have had a lot of burden on [their] shoulders and I just think they have done an incredible job.” <br><br> In contrast to the veteran-laden Lady Vols, those largely responsible for Maryland’s school-record 27-game winning streak and Big Ten regular season and tournament titles this season are sophomores. Shatori Walker-Kimbrough, a sophomore guard-forward, had 24 points on 10-of-15 shooting in the region semifinals, and sophomore center Brionna Jones added 10 points and 10 rebounds. <br><br> Brown, meanwhile, had her least productive game since becoming a starter four games into her freshman season. The first-team all-Big Ten selection in Maryland’s first season in the conference managed one point in the region semifinals, missing all seven of her field goal attempts. <br><br> She played just 24 minutes, with Coach Brenda Frese turning to reserves Brene Moseley, a redshirt junior, and freshman Kristen Confroy to handle the ball. <br><br> “Obviously at this point, you’re only going to have elite level teams, great teams that are left to play in the Elite Eight,” Frese said. “So I think that it will come down to both teams, their battle of wills, both teams being able to take away each other’s strengths and who’s able to do that.” <br><br>;Forward reference manipulated headline;15:30:00;2015-03-29;https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/03/29/Sports/Images/terps041427661310.jpg;Maryland’s Lexie Brown starts a play during practice under the watchful eye of Coach Brenda Frese.

ca334a80-34d4-11e1-88f9-9084fc48c348;Michigan football enters 2012 Sugar Bowl with a new attitude on defense;NEW ORLEANS — Michigan defensive lineman Ryan Van Bergen thought he had seen and heard it all during his previous four years in Ann Arbor, from being a part of Lloyd Carr’s final team in 2007 to the tumultuous three years that followed under Rich Rodriguez to finishing the 2010 season with the third-worst defense among Bowl Championship Series conference teams. <br><br> But then one day this past spring, new defensive coordinator Greg Mattison popped in some video of the Baltimore Ravens, his previous coaching stop, and told the 288-pound Van Bergen he wanted him to emulate defensive tackle Haloti Ngata. <br><br> “I was like, ‘So you want me to play like Haloti Ngata?’ ” Van Bergen recalled this week. “He was like, ‘Yeah,’ and gave me the shrug like I’m crazy for not knowing what he meant. ‘Haloti Ngata is 330 [pounds]. I’m not Haloti Ngata, coach.’ ” <br><br> The Wolverines can laugh about those first days under a new regime now, but when Michigan takes the field Tuesday to face Virginia Tech in the Sugar Bowl, it will be the final validation for a coaching staff and a defense that have been the catalysts for a dramatic culture change at the winningest program in college football. <br><br> A year after ESPN analyst Chris Spielman referred to Michigan’s defense as “a bunch of guys who would be nice little subs at Indiana,” the Wolverines have improved to 17th in the country without making significant personnel changes. Instead, as Virginia Tech’s coaches have pointed out several times this week, it has been Mattison and first-year Coach Brady Hoke’s ability to “coach them up” that has led the Wolverines to their first BCS game since 2007. <br><br> “These coaches just really understand the Michigan tradition,” defensive end Craig Roh said. “They’ve brought it to life through practice, through camp, through all that stuff. It has enlivened all of us right now. I think that’s why you see, I guess, a change in the environment.” <br><br> When Hoke and Mattison first returned to Ann Arbor — Hoke was a defensive line coach when Michigan shared the 1997 national championship and Mattison was the Wolverines’ defensive coordinator in 1995 and 1996 — they encountered a team that “broke every record you didn’t want to break as a team,” Van Bergen said this week. “I would think that we have a blueprint as far as what not to do.” <br><br> Enter Mattison, who had spent the past two years as the Ravens’ defensive coordinator when his good friend, Hoke, called one day wondering if he’d be interested in returning to the college ranks. <br><br> To the surprise of some, Mattison took the job rather than staying in Baltimore to coach Ray Lewis and Ed Reed. <br><br> “I just missed the chance to take some young man that maybe is not a great football player, or people say he’s not a great football player, or he doesn’t believe he’s a great football player, and help him get to become as great as he can,” said Mattison, who added he wouldn’t have made the move if it were any other school. “That’s something that I’ve always enjoyed in all my years of coaching and I missed it.” <br><br> Mattison brought with him the complex coverage schemes of the NFL and blitz packages that are so extensive Virginia Tech offensive coordinator Bryan Stinespring said recently, “It’s almost like they’ve got a different playbook.” <br><br> The end results are evident on the scoreboard. <br><br> The Wolverines have gone from giving up more than 35 points per game in 2010 to allowing just more than 17 points per contest this season. Michigan never finished higher than 67th in the country in total defense under Rodriguez, but with players almost exclusively recruited by previous regimes the Wolverines moved up to 17th this year. <br><br> But for a unit that had “experienced so much pain and suffering,” according to Roh, it was Mattison’s tacit belief that seemed to make all the difference. And so even though Van Bergen still jokes about being compared to Ngata, he’s more than happy to point out just how far this defense has come. <br><br> “I don’t think it had anything to do with buying in. It was more about staying in. When things started going wrong, you could see the team kind of fall apart a little bit,” Van Bergen said of past seasons. “Guys didn’t want to be too committed because if you’re too committed and things start going wrong, you can take a lot of the blame. . . . <br><br> “We’ve been through the worst of fires, we’ve been through the worst that can happen to us, so whatever these coaches tell us to do, let’s make sure we don’t have any regrets. We’re sitting here right now and I don’t think there’s a guy on the team probably too regretful about anything.” <br><br>;Forward reference manipulated headline;19:27:55;2012-01-01;https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2012/01/02/Sports/Images/Sugar_Bowl_Michigan_Football_05de3-18006.jpg;Michigan defensive end Ryan Van Bergen (53) runs through drills in practice before the Sugar Bowl against Virginia Tech on Tuesday.

4e1aedb770bc7fb759d93a2ff3e17ad4;Donald Trump hints he will sign RNC loyalty pledge;RICHMOND -- Donald Trump said Thursday morning that signing a loyalty pledge designed to block him from running for president as an independent would give him the best shot at winning the Republican primary. <br><br> Asked by conservative radio show host John Fredericks if he would sign a statement that the Republican National Committee circulated to presidential candidates Wednesday, Trump said he would make a final decision after a meeting Thursday with RNC Chairman Reince Priebus. <br><br> “It is possible. We’re going to have a meeting,” Trump said. <br><br> Already leading in the polls, Trump said he believes his popularity would increase should he rule out a third-party bid. He even appeared to slip at one point and say point-blank that he would sign the pledge. <br><br> “There are those that say you go up if you do, and I’m not doing it for that. I’m doing it for – I mean, we’re going to see what happens, we have a meeting – but certainly it would be advantageous to do it that way, and I think our best chance for victory is to do it that way. But I’m going to have to hear the chairman out,” he said. <br><br> The RNC pledge is similar to statements some state parties routinely ask candidates at all levels of elected office to sign. The Virginia GOP has had a version of the pledge and plans to discuss a proposal for presidential hopefuls at a meeting later this month. The move is widely seen as an attempt to box in Trump, but Virginia GOP Chairman John Whitbeck said it is intended to motivate Republican activists. <br><br> Trump said he’ll probably announce his decision Thursday at a 2 p.m. news conference. <br><br> “Look, my number one thing is to win, and the best way to win is as a Republican,” he said. “The third party thing is a tough thing, it’s a tough route. And I believe that it can be done, but it’s a tougher route, it’s a riskier route. And certainly it would give Hillary, or whoever’s going to be running on the other side, a better shot, let’s face it.

abdb2ffa551f4dd33426b962c91b25a6;Start-up that automates charitable donation raises $1.65 million from investors;The ALS ice bucket challenge is thought of as one of the first charity campaigns to figure out how to use social media. But imagine that, every time someone posted #IceBucketChallenge on Twitter, money was automatically pulled from their checking account? <br><br> District start-up GoodWorld is aiming to put the Twitter-sphere’s money where its hashtag is – and now investors are taking notice to the tune of $1.65 million. <br><br> Here’s how it works: Once a donor signs up with GoodWorld, giving a donation to a charity becomes a one-step process that takes no longer than it takes to compose a tweet or a Facebook post. When a charity registers with GoodWorld, anyone can donate to the cause simply by adding #donate, followed by @[name of charity] on Twitter. On Facebook the donor has to use #donate in a post with the amount they’d like to give, posted on the nonprofit’s Facebook page. GoodWorld takes a 4.8 percent cut of each donation and another 2.2 percent goes to the credit card company, but the rest of each donation goes directly to the nonprofit groups. <br><br> [Meet GoodWorld, the start-up that wants to make giving to charity as easy as using a hashtag] <br><br> The start-up launched last October with just seven charities, and now there are almost 200 nonprofit groups in GoodWorld’s system, and almost 4,000 donors have signed up. What started as a team of four has grown to 12 people based out of District start-up incubator 1776, and the company announced Tuesday that it has secured $1.65 million in seed funding. <br><br> Seeking to “democratize the landscape for donors,” as chief executive Dale Pfeifer puts it, the company says it is attempting to make it easier for donors to contribute to their favorite causes, beating popular crowd-funding sites like Indiegogo by just a few critical clicks. <br><br> “People hate to click links. They’ll sit there on Facebook and ask questions all day long but they won’t click and follow a link,” said Ryan Moore, vice president of social media fundraising and promotions at the Beagle Freedom Project, an animal protection organization that has piloted GoodWorld’s software. Moore says his organization has raised almost $40,000 through GoodWorld’s technology after just a few months. <br><br> And the instantaneous nature of donations makes it easier for nonprofits to conduct rapid-fire fundraising efforts in the event of a crisis. <br><br> “Since we’re a rescue organization, being able to remind people about a rescue that we’re on, and having people be able to donate simply by posting [on social media] has been revolutionary for us,” said Tim Woodward, chief operations officer at Animal Rescue Corps, a nonprofit organization that advocates against animal cruelty and responds to specific cases of animal cruelty. “It works particularly well for us when we’re on scene in the moment and people feel the urgency.” <br><br> Woodward’s team tested the fundraising software by asking the Internet for help with patching up some of their response vehicles that needed work. They agreed to be one of GoodWorld’s initial product testers in February, and in March they held a “fix up the fleet” campaign that raised $5,000 in less than a week. Woodward estimates they have raised more than $10,000 with the software. <br><br> The latest round of fundraising was co-led by New York-based Nyca Partners,  a venture capital firm. Chris Liddell, an investor who served as the chief financial officer for both Microsoft and General Motors, also contributed to this round of funding. The raise includes an initial $500,000 round of investment that included Katharine Weymouth, the former publisher of The Washington Post. <br><br> “The ability to transfer money on social media with just a hashtag is revolutionary for the financial technology sector – a space ripe for disruption,” Hans Morris, managing director of Nyca Partners, which led the latest round of funding, said in a statement. <br><br> GoodWorld executives say their next challenge is figuring out how to turn online donation into a game, coaxing users to donate by finding ways to pit them against one another, such as offering prizes for the top donor on an individual post. <br><br> “Social media is a very new channel for donations that’s very different from what anyone else has done, this is more of a call-and-response activity,” GoodWorld’s chief executive Pfeifer said. <br><br> “People like to feel like they’re not just giving, they’re also receiving. They want to feel like they’re a part of something.” <br><br>;Question manipulated headline;07:35:54;2015-07-07;https://img.washingtonpost.com/news/on-small-business/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2015/07/Goodworld2-blurred.png;A Facebook user donates $30 by posting on a non-profit’s page.

9d4387b0-3308-11e6-95c0-2a6873031302;Unwrapping that home computer started a lonely kid on a path to business success;"Mykel Nahorniak was a youngster growing up in Orton, Ontario (pop. 2,595), an hour northwest of Toronto, when his father brought home an Atari computer. The future techie, barely old enough to read, took to the little machine as if it were skates and a hockey stick. <br><br> As Nahorniak got older, the computer became his link to the outside world. The teenager used his computer skills to trade music, compare video-game scores and connect with other like-minded techies through a online bulletin board service via a dial-up Internet connection. <br><br> “I was pretty bored . . . feeling isolated,” said Nahorniak, whose nearest neighbor growing up was a mile away. “That was what attracted me to the Internet.” <br><br> The 32-year-old entrepreneur took his love for networking and co-founded Localist, a Silver Spring-based software-maker that now tries to help others connect with the outside world. <br><br> Facebook it ain’t. Neither is it a social network. But seven-year-old Localist earns revenue in the single-digit millions, and is a profitable enterprise with 15 employees. It has a customer base of more than 200 universities, hospital systems, companies and tourism boards that pay from $7,000 to $60,000 a year to subscribe to Localist’s calendar-event software. <br><br> Enoch Pratt Library in Baltimore uses it to inform parents of the time and place for the next preschool story-and-song session; you need only click a button to signal that you are attending. You can find the next 5k obstacle race that way on Travel Portland. Looking for the Health HeartHow lecture? New York-Presbyterian Hospital’s Localist online calendar tells you where and when. <br><br> Nahorniak said he is proud of the fact that he now helps run his company without outside ownership. An early $300,000 investment from a Chicago businessman was paid back in 18 months, and the company has grown on its retained earnings, giving it the flexibility and autonomy that Nahorniak said he craves. <br><br> “Our meetings with venture capitalists left a sour taste in our mouths,” Nahorniak said. “Our interests weren’t aligned. They were focused on the monetary gain, which is their job. We were focused on connecting people better.” <br><br> Folks in the venture-capital community, who have funded the Googles, Facebooks, Amazons and Microsofts of the world, would of course disagree. Even Nahorniak acknowledges “Localist wouldn’t be here today without outside investment.” <br><br> He doesn’t rule out using venture-capital money in the future, though, to grow his company. But he has resisted the urge to take on more owners (he is one of three co-owners), coveting the independence he has by staying small. <br><br> Nahorniak’s family moved to Fairfax County in 1997, where his father had taken a telecommunications job. The young computer geek attended South Lakes High School, where he was a subpar student. He cranked all night building programs on his computer, sleeping his way though classes during the day. <br><br> By 15, he was earning cash as a freelance Web developer for public relations agencies and government contractors. College was not in the cards, so he took a series of database and computer jobs until a chance meeting at a party led him to the information technology department at the Baltimore Sun in 2005. <br><br> While working at the Sun, he and a high school buddy stumbled into a restaurant in downtown Baltimore “packed with hip, happening people,” Nahorniak said. When they returned the next week, the place was empty. <br><br> “That sparked the idea for Localist,” he said. “Wouldn’t it be cool if there were a website that told you ahead of time where people are going without needing to know someone, without having to spot a flier in a coffee shop?” <br><br> He and his friend hammered out the details during evenings at a Starbucks in Baltimore’s Fells Point neighborhood. How would they find content? Who is the audience? Nahorniak quit his job at the Sun in 2007 to devote more time to the project. <br><br> For a while, they worked under the name “Socializer,” then sold the domain and trademark name for a six-figure sum to keep their project alive. They eventually abandoned the original business plan after realizing the magnitude of cataloguing a city’s nightlife. “Eighty percent of events are completely offline,” Nahorniak said. “The only way you can learn about them is word of mouth.” <br><br> Socializer’s ad-based revenue model also prevented it from making enough money to grow, which created another shortcoming. <br><br> Their “aha moment” arrived in the summer of 2009. <br><br> Nahorniak thought up the idea of selling software calendars to universities, where students, faculty and administrators regularly juggle a host of events. The idea was to sell the software and let the schools enter the calendar information. <br><br> “Ninety percent of freshmen look to universities to tell them about events,” Nahorniak said. “Universities don’t have a content problem, because the school administrators must approve every single event that happens.” <br><br> That solved the problem of centralization, allowing one source to promote, publish and manage the content. <br><br> A friend arranged an introduction to Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. <br><br> The Johns Hopkins calendar at the time was underutilized and fragmented, requiring each department to manage its own events. <br><br> Nahorniak’s team suggested inverting the process, allowing their software to be a vehicle for students to find cultural, intellectual and social meetups. <br><br> “We go in and say, ‘Here is what Localist is today. Here is what it could be if we turn it into a platform for your students.’ We knew we were onto something. We looked at it as, ‘This is what students want to know.’ ” <br><br> After nailing the Johns Hopkins account, Nahorniak and his small team took the $300,000 from the Chicago investor in return for a piece of ownership.

deb31c1a-7ceb-11e1-a01f-52d5c6187537;FAQ: The Global Payments hack;Global Payments announced Friday that 1.5 million credit card numbers from its systems may have been exposed after detecting “unauthorized access” into its processing system. Here’s a quick primer on the attack, what the reaction has been and what you can do to protect yourself. <br><br> What is Global Payments? Global Payments is a third-party processing company that has clients including financial institutions, government agencies and large corporations. Clients at the time of the breach included Visa and MasterCard. <br><br> Who was affected? The company said that 1.5 million records may have been exposed, from Visa and MasterCard. <br><br> What was taken?  According to the company, while credit card numbers may have been exposed, personal information such as names, addresses and Social Security numbers were “not obtained by the criminals.” <br><br> When did it happen? Global Payments detected the breach in “early March,” but has not specified when exactly the attack took place or how it happened. <br><br> What’s been done in response? According to the latest statement from Global Payments, the breach has been “contained.” The company said it is working with “industry third parties, regulators and law enforcement to assist in the efforts to minimize potential cardholder impact.” It is also working with security and forensics firms to get to the bottom of the access. <br><br> What should I be looking out for? As a cardholder, you should keep an even closer eye on your bank statements to look for unauthorized charges. Investigate and report any anomalies as quickly as possible. <br><br> Also, be aware of phishing scams. Keep in mind that no reputable firm will ever ask you to enter your username and password into an e-mail, and any e-mails asking for that information should be deleted immediately. <br><br> I think my account’s been compromised. What can I do? If you’re worried about charges you’ve found on your cards, contact your card company immediately. Cards often have a toll-free number printed on them in case of emergency. <br><br> You can also put a fraud alert on your credit report to contain the damage from bad charges. Contact the three major credit report companies — Experian, Equifax and TransUnion — to do so. <br><br> For more information, or to report a fraud complaint, check out the Federal Trade Commission’s information on credit fraud. <br><br> Related stories: <br><br> Global Payments says Visa had dropped it after big data breach, hopes to reclaim business <br><br> Global Payments says data breach may have affected less than 1.5M credit card numbers <br><br>;;13:26:00;2012-04-02;https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2011/11/10/National-Economy/Images/926632-4059.jpg;Visa has dropped Global Payments following the data breach  (Andrew Harrer/BLOOMBERG) <br><br>;Hayley Tsukayama covers consumer technology for The Washington Post. <br><br>;2;X
ac8b0820b324e04d6a186719e3977e09;Rand Paul wins support of GOP ‘liberty’ caucus;"The Republican Liberty Caucus, a 25-year old union of the GOP's libertarian-leaning activists, has endorsed Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) for president over Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.). Coming just hours before Paul gets a Senate vote on his legislation to audit the Federal Reserve, his campaign is calling this a victory in the ""liberty lane"" of the Republican primary. <br><br> ""Senator Paul is the candidate of choice among our state charters and membership at large,” said RLC National Chairman Matt Nye in a Tuesday morning statement. “Senator Paul has been a consistent favorite with our members since he announced his candidacy."" <br><br> As Paul's presidential campaign has worked to regain footing in the primary, it's beseeched libertarian-leaning Republicans not to join Cruz's bandwagon. That effort has largely succeed, with some close calls. In October, the Paul campaign worked hurriedly to win a straw poll at the RLC's New Hampshire-based convention, where Cruz made a surprise appearance. When a confusing two-ballot system handed Paul the win, Cruz's campaign declared partial victory anyway, noting that ""51 percent"" of the combined ballots were marked for Cruz. Paul's campaign, which blamed Cruz for rumors of internal disarray, bragged that Cruz had been ""conquered."" <br><br> In the ensuing weeks, despite well-received debate performances, Paul continued to lag behind Cruz. On Jan. 3, RLC National Director Steve Hoffman told the blog Conservative Fifty that he was personally switching from Paul to Cruz. ""At our recent RLC national convention, Paul and Cruz were nearly tied in our straw poll, with Rand being a few points ahead,"" he explained. ""So it’s clear that within the RLC, Cruz and Paul stand out as the two acceptable candidates."" <br><br> Paul has sharpened his rhetoric about Cruz; in a series of half-festive, half-revealing New Years tweets, he resolved ""to give @TedCruz more lead time before I announce my policy positions, so he can replicate them faster."" Had the RLC issued no endorsement, after endorsing Paul's father in the 2012 primaries, it would have hinted at serious defections from his base. But two-thirds of RLC members, many of whom entered or re-engaged with politics because of Ron Paul's presidential campaigns, prevented catastrophe. <br><br> Cruz's campaign, which has alerted reporters to any defections from Paul's camp, was sanguine about the RLC vote. <br><br> ""The reason our campaign has been so successful is because conservatives, including many in the Liberty movement, are supporting Ted Cruz,"" said Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler. ""We did not expect the endorsement of the NH RLC but we are proud to have the support of many of its members."" <br><br> Paul's campaign, meanwhile, was boasting of an unconditional victory. <br><br> ""As the only liberty-minded candidate,"" said Paul spokesman Sergio Gor, ""Senator Paul is very pleased and grateful to the Republican Liberty Caucus."" <br><br>";;10:44:31;2016-01-12;https://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/files/2016/01/180224653.jpg;"Sens.

883108b43e71af085bef3ad3a0e3e595;A surprising map of where men outnumber women online — and where they don’t;"We often speak of the Internet as a boys’ club, particularly with regard to public spaces like Twitter. But a map published Monday by German developer Ramiro Gómez to the infographics site Visualizing makes it clear exactly how apt that “boys’ club” description is: In at least half a dozen of the world’s biggest economies, men still outnumber women online, sometimes by a considerable margin. <br><br> Before you ask, yes — this data is legit. Gómez, an active contributor to Visualizing, sourced his ratios from the International Telecommunications Union, the U.N.-designated agency that is responsible, among other things, for compiling and standardizing data on who has Internet access where. For at least the past 10 years, the ITU has paid special attention to women — and for good reason. Internet use is an important indicator of things like educational attainment and economic participation, areas where women frequently lag behind men, as well as greater economic health. <br><br> It’s perhaps no surprise, then, that the digital gender gap appears most severe in countries like Turkey, Iran, Indonesia and Morocco, countries with developing economies and mixed records on women’s rights. Meanwhile, Australia, Canada, the United States, Brazil and much of Western Europe have achieved something approaching parity: In the United States, in fact, ITU statistics indicate that slightly more women use the Internet than men. <br><br> The outliers here may be Japan and Italy, which show a gap despite the traditional strength of their economies. In Italy’s case, at least, that may relate to that country’s relatively late adoption of the Internet, or so a paper on “Gender and Internet Usage” hazarded in 2003. But Japan is another case entirely: For reasons that remain somewhat murky to economists, that nation has long suffered from dramatic gender inequality, earning a ranking just above Nigeria and the United Arab Emirates on the World Economic Forum’s latest index. In 2012, the WEF even launched a pilot program in Japan “to foster public-private collaboration on closing the gender gap.” <br><br> <iframe width=""480"" height=""270"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/blIEuGpSnIs?feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe> <br><br> That kind of proactive policy is also what the ITU is hoping for. In memos, press releases and working group meetings, the agency has reiterated its hope that statistics on the Internet gender gap could spark policy changes or private initiatives that pull female users to the Internet. That would include initiatives like Google India’s “Helping Women Get Online,” which has funded a national media campaign on “Internet Moms” and a toll-free tech support line for women. Per that campaign: <br><br> India is one of the few countries in the world where the online audience is very skewed towards the male population, with only 30% of the active Internet users as women .. Studies have shown that if women were to get online it would have a very positive impact on their lives, their status as well as the society. <br><br> We still need more data, though. Google’s 30 percent estimate comes from a private firm. The ITU, which relies on national statistics organizations for its numbers, only has data from 64 of the world’s 190-plus countries. That doesn’t include heavyweights like India, China and Russia. <br><br> Despite those drawbacks, there’s room for hope. Past experience has shown that Internet access, and women’s Internet access, both tend to swing up the longer the Internet is around. So maybe next time Gómez makes this kind of map, there will be more green and yellow on the page. <br><br>";;11:00:25;2014-05-20;https://img.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp-content/uploads/sites/32/2014/05/internet-users-europe.jpg;(ITU) <br><br>;Caitlin Dewey is the food policy writer for Wonkblog.

3f9692ea-a4d5-11e5-b53d-972e2751f433;Greet and eat the new year like Dorie Greenspan: With a mashup;"Bonjour from Paris, where I’m celebrating the coming new year. It’s a decades-old family tradition and one that centers, as our favorite traditions do, on food: New Year’s Eve always turns into our biggest dinner party of the year! <br><br> We never know how many we’ll be; some years (and this is one of them), we have to set up a couple of tables in the living room. But we do know that we’ll have lots of champagne and gougères, spiced nuts and toasts with something delicious on them before we sit down to a long dinner that always includes oysters, a brothy main course (because I own 36 shallow soup plates!), Mont d’Or and Comté for the cheese course, and custards and cookies for dessert. Between the oysters and the main course, I’ll serve the 2015 version of salmon rillettes. I make some play on this mix of poached and fresh salmon every year, and this year’s might be my most unusual yet. It’s sparked with gochujang, the Korean sweet-and-spicy paste that’s gaining on Sriracha in the popularity polls, and togarashi, the fiery Japanese red pepper blend. <br><br> Talk about a cultural mashup. Rillettes are a time-honored French preparation traditionally made by cooking pork or duck in its own fat until the meat is soft enough to spread on a hunk of bread. It’s a rich concoction, almost by definition, and all the more wonderful for that richness. Rillettes are a staple of charcuteries all over France; you can find them packed into crocks and can buy them by the heaping spoonful. <br><br> These days, rillettes are made with a variety of ingredients, from canned sardines and tuna to chicken and mackerel, smoked and fresh. And where the potted meats had to cook for hours, the new rillettes are quickly made and need just a couple of hours in the fridge to set their texture. <br><br> My rillettes use slivered smoked salmon and chunks of poached fresh salmon. (Recently, faced with no access to my favorite fishmonger, I made the rillettes with frozen wild Alaskan sockeye salmon, and they were great.) The salmon is poached for a minute in wine and water, left covered for 10 minutes and then chilled briefly. Once united, the smoked and fresh salmon are made spreadable with the addition of softened butter and mayonnaise; spicy with togarashi (you can use ground cayenne pepper) and gochujang; tangy with rice vinegar and lemon; sharp with scallions and shallots; and herbal with cilantro. <br><br> With something this simple, there’s plenty of room to play around. Dill is just as good as cilantro, and seaweed flakes are interesting; clementines can stand in for lemon (they’re sweeter, of course, so you might want a splash more vinegar); Sriracha can bump the gochujang, but be careful, because it’s hotter; and if you want crunch, consider tossing in toasted sesame seeds. <br><br> For New Year’s Eve, I’m going dressy, serving a scoop of rillettes on a plate with a slice of smoked salmon, brioche and a wedge of lemon. My usual is a whole lot less fancy: I pack the mix in a preserving jar and nibble at it from morning to midnight, spreading it on whatever I’ve got at hand, including Triscuits, wheat crackers, baguette, rye bread, endive and celery stalks. It’s a great host gift, so make extra. I do. <br><br> Wishing you and yours a “joyeux” new year. A delicious one, too. <br><br>";;01:08:49;2015-12-27;https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/12/24/Food/Images/food_0151450969751.jpg;Franco-American Salmon Rillettes.

146c449090abb77d4137e42bca071846;This is one big reason why Obama won a second term;"Conventional wisdom surrounding the 2012 election goes like this: President Obama won -- at least in large part -- due to the superiority of his ground game. President Obama had the uber-effective Narwhal; Mitt Romney had the decidedly ineffective Orca.  As a result, the Obama team were in far greater touch with their potential voters throughout the campaign -- a level of contact that translated into a superior turnout effort on Election Day. <br><br> Makes sense, right? Except that according to a new paper-- entitled ""The Ground Game from the Voter's Perspective: 2012 and Before"" -- by Ohio State's Paul Beck and Erik Heidemann, formerly of Kent State University, the ground games of Obama and Romney were virtually identical. <br><br> Here's the chart the duo built based on information gathered via a national survey conducted by the Comparative National Election Project (CNEP) detailing contacts made by the two parties during the 2012 election. <br><br> And here's that same chart focused on the 11 battleground states of Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin. <br><br> In the battlegrounds, the Romney campaign actually had more total contacts with voters than did the Obama campaign -- holding clear edges on direct mail and phone contacts. ""These data challenge the claim of an Obama advantage in the ground game, especially one substantial enough to be credited with a victory built upon a virtual sweep of the battleground states,"" write Beck and Heidemann. ""Instead, and especially in the battlegrounds, the Romney campaign and Republican party seemed to duel the Obama campaign and Democratic party to a draw."" <br><br> There is an important caveat to all of the above. While Romney out-contacted Obama overall, the president's campaign held a lead in one critical place: In-person contacts. <br><br> Write Beck/Heidemann: ""While the edge was based on contacts with only a small slice of the electorate, it probably was the most consequential of all the contacts....we project that the Obama campaign personally contacted about 7 million more voters than the Romney campaign in all states and about 3.6 million more in the battleground states, which Obama won by a total of 1.6 million votes."" <br><br> The lesson? All campaign contacts are not created equal. Personal contacts matter far more. That is what the Obama campaign knew -- and what the Romney campaign didn't. And that is a big reason why Obama won a second term. <br><br>";;13:18:37;2013-11-19;https://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/files/2013/11/Screen-Shot-2013-11-19-at-1.10.48-PM1.png;Image courtesy of Beck/Heidemann <br><br>;Chris Cillizza writes “The Fix,” a politics blog for The Washington Post. <br><br>;2;X
f3ec6f3e-a005-11e3-9ba6-800d1192d08b;Jim Boeheim, Syracuse the talk of the ACC ahead of showdown at Virginia;Syracuse Athletic Director Daryl Gross first heard the story from sports information director Pete Moore on Monday night at Comcast Center, outside the visitor’s locker room moments after another win. <br><br> Longtime Coach Jim Boeheim had just refused ESPN’s postgame request for an interview after a 57-55 victory over Maryland, ignoring an approaching microphone and walking off the court after working his way through the handshake line. <br><br> It was on principle. The network wanted to interview him before the game about his first career ejection at Duke two days earlier. Boeheim only wanted to talk about his team and that night’s game. The Syracuse delegation all agreed with the coach’s decision. They knew he would have plenty to say a few minutes later. <br><br> Boeheim, after emerging for his news conference, would soon take on Maryland Coach Mark Turgeon for complaining about the officials, contorting his face with every thought, cracking jokes and generally getting himself into and out of trouble with that sarcastic, self-deprecating charm nobody else in college basketball can pull off. <br><br> “I’m sorry I wasn’t funny tonight,” Boeheim said as he departed the podium 10 minutes later to laughter. Gross left the room shaking his head. <br><br> “That’s why we love him,” he said. <br><br> Like its 69-year-old coach, No. 4 Syracuse (26-2, 13-2) has been narrowly avoiding most pitfalls for weeks now. Seven of its past eight games have been decided by six points or fewer, with many ending in dramatic fashion. <br><br> Though the win over the Terrapins snapped a two-game losing streak that knocked the Orange from atop the national polls and ended an undefeated season, Syracuse enters Saturday’s showdown at No. 12 Virginia (24-5, 15-1) in position to win the ACC regular season title in its inaugural season in the conference. <br><br> “I can’t remember any team that we’ve had that’s had to grind it as hard as this team. I mean, not any good teams,” Boeheim said this week in a telephone interview. <br><br> This one came together in the summer, after Syracuse played an exhibition tour in Canada and Boeheim realized freshman point guard Tyler Ennis and sophomore sharpshooter Trevor Cooney could be one of the nation’s most potent back courts. Senior C.J. Fair has lived up to his preseason ACC player of the year billing and forward Jerami Grant, an All-Met from DeMatha, has brought scoring punch inside. <br><br> But the Orange still relies on Boeheim’s famed 2-3 zone. The team hasn’t scored more than 61 points in its past seven games but ranks seventh in the country in scoring defense. <br><br> Nonetheless, Syracuse has quickly become one of the ACC’s most powerful brands during its first season in the league. The Orange’s two games with Duke garnered huge television ratings — its first game against Duke on Feb. 1 was the third-most-viewed regular season men’s college basketball game in ESPN history — and Boeheim has joined Mike Krzyzewski and Roy Williams atop the league’s coaching hierarchy. <br><br> Boeheim was hesitant to embrace the ACC after so many years in the Big East, but he said this week the new series with the Blue Devils and the return of Notre Dame and Pittsburgh to the schedule “has really filled in” for the loss of other traditional rivals. He even liked the Italian food in Winston-Salem, N.C. <br><br> ACC Commissioner John Swofford has also given Boeheim the freedom to speak his mind, not fining him after his explosion at Duke last Saturday, which also included a rebuke of the league’s schedule makers for giving Maryland the weekend off when the Orange had to play on two days’ rest. <br><br> But both Boeheim and Fair lamented how much they would miss the Big East tournament at Madison Square Garden. <br><br> “The players have kind of taken it all in, almost like a tourist,” said Syracuse assistant coach Adrian Autry, who previously spent three years at Virginia Tech. “I think [Boeheim] is adjusting. It’s still basketball and he loves coaching basketball.” <br><br> This week, though, all anybody wanted to talk about was Boeheim’s now-infamous tirade after a disputed charging call at Duke. Not his 946 career wins or Syracuse’s chances now that March is fast approaching. Just whether he cost his team the game. <br><br> By Wednesday morning, he had said on national radio that his reaction last Saturday night ”went too far.” A few hours after that, accompanied with a joke about his golf game, Boeheim explained why he felt so bad over the phone. <br><br> “I think when you coach a team and they’re trying to do what you want them to do and they show a lot of heart, toughness and tenacity, I think you love being around them,” he said. <br><br> “This team is that kind of team, and it gives you a lot of satisfaction.” <br><br>;;18:22:07;2014-02-27;https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/02/28/Sports/Images/Syracuse_Duke_Basketball-04194.jpg;Jim Boeheim might have been perplexed by the refs at Cameron Indoor Stadium, but his Syracuse team can still win the ACC title in its first year in the conference.

f04a121df94c5fd0bed95a50222ee20b;Airbnb’s battle with San Francisco shows the payoff to going up against regulators;Home-sharing company Airbnb cleared a major legal hurdle in its hometown of San Francisco on Monday, settling a case that was viewed by many in Silicon Valley as a bellwether for how far start-ups can go to test government. <br><br> The legal settlement with the city over unregistered listings marks the end of a multiyear battle that pit affordable housing advocates and some local officials against home-sharing start-ups and the wider tech community. Ultimately, Airbnb and its co-defendant, HomeAway, conceded to many of the city’s demands, but also showed other start-ups that there is a payoff to flexing some legal muscle and going up against regulators. <br><br> Under the settlement, Airbnb agreed to build software that would automatically send the city the names and address of hosts who sign up locally. People who are already hosts have 8 months to register. <br><br> “While we’re happy to see a homegrown San Francisco company like Airbnb succeed, it can’t be at the expense of residents being evicted or units being removed from the housing market so people can make more money putting apartments on Airbnb,” said San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera in a news release. <br><br> Currently just 2,100 short-term hosts are registered in San Francisco. Airbnb has more than 8,000 listings, according to Herrera. <br><br> Nine years after its founding, Airbnb has become a juggernaut powerful enough to threaten the U.S. hotel industry. But a series of intractable battles with regulators in cities across the world has threatened the $31 billion company’s rise — and its ability to go public. <br><br> It took a while for regulators to catch on though. San Francisco didn’t enact laws addressing home-sharing until 2015, when the city legalized renting out one’s home on a short-term basis. The laws required hosts to register with the city and banned individuals from renting out multiple homes or renting their home for more than 90-days a year. Affordable housing advocates and officials say that turning homes into vacation rentals for most of the year cuts down on the housing supply that is available to locals and pushes up prices. <br><br> But very few Airbnb hosts have actually registered, causing the city to clamp down further. The ordinance would have fined the short-term rental companies up to $1,000 per day for each illegal listing, along with additional criminal penalties for arranging bookings that flouted the city’s registration system. In June last year, Airbnb sued to block the law. <br><br> Airbnb and HomeAway argued that the San Francisco rules violated the First Amendment and the Communications Decency Act, a 20-year-old statute that is considered a pillar of the Web economy. The Act says Internet platforms cannot be held responsible for the illegal activity of third parties that use them to do business. For example, Google is not liable for child pornography posted by advertisers using its software. The San Francisco case raised questions about whether Airbnb’s role as a platform made it more similar to Google’s ad business, per se, than to other platform-like companies such as credit card processors, which can be held responsible if fraudsters use their technology to launder money. Those questions have implications for many Silicon Valley businesses, from eBay to car-sharing apps. <br><br> Airbnb has also argued, in San Francisco and in other cities, that sharing information about its hosts would violate their privacy. Critics countered that Airbnb was defending hosts that break local laws to protect its bottom line. <br><br> Many of those higher-level questions weren’t decided in the settlement, which established a registration system that both parties could agree upon and set up conditions under which Airbnb would agree to drop its lawsuit. <br><br> “While the city's laws were well-intentioned, it did include an onerous registration system. And while we've certainly had issues with the city at various points along the way, we are very appreciative of the San Francisco city attorneys office for this settlement. All the parties really rolled up their sleeves,” said Airbnb's head of global policy Chris Lehane. <br><br> “We really want to be able to move on and talk about other things — be able to move forward.” <br><br> But lessons can still be drawn from the complicated dance that large start-ups like Airbnb and Uber have engaged in with regulators. <br><br> Going into the lawsuit, Airbnb was likely to be well-aware that it had a strong bargaining chip: the city would have a hard time enforcing its registration laws without the company’s help. How, in practical terms, could a handful of city officials, spending their days combing through thousands of listings on Airbnb, actually detect lawbreaking homeowners? <br><br> A win may have set a legal precedent, but it may not have helped San Francisco accomplish its actual goal of identifying lawbreaking hosts. <br><br> At the same time, and despite all appearances, Airbnb doesn't ultimately want to be at odds with cities. Legal battles can spook investors, customers, and hosts. The company's policy team, led by former Bill Clinton aide Lehane, relishes a fight as much as anyone, but he knows the company benefits more from dealmaking. <br><br> That is why Airbnb has built similar registration systems in other cities, such as Chicago and New Orleans. Those other deals, which also involve Airbnb collecting local taxes, were also the result of protracted negotiations. They did not end in lawsuits, which Lehane calls a last resort. <br><br> If these concessions have damaged Airbnb's business, the company isn't disclosing it, and it's too early for outsiders to tell. But they have arguably helped the company gain something more important in the near term: legitimacy and a green light to operate. <br><br>;;05:00:32;2017-05-02;https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2017-05-01/AP/Airbnb_Legal_Fight_San_Francisco_91100-35f79.jpg;City Attorney Dennis Herrera, at podium, talks about a settlement agreement on short term rentals during a news conference Monday, May 1, 2017, at City Hall in San Francisco.

63ce9a22375d6ad8938499700cd57071;George Pataki speaks up for respect and tolerance;"Earlier this week, a video of Mike Huckabee speaking surfaced. It contained these remarks from a speech in February: “Simply recognize that the fact that we are now in city after city watching ordinances say that your seven-year-old daughter, if she goes into the restroom cannot be offended and you can’t be offended if she’s greeted there by a 42-year-old man who feels more like a woman than he does a man.” He did not stop there: “Now I wish that someone told me that when I was in high school that I could have felt like a woman when it came time to take showers in PE. I’m pretty sure that I would have found my feminine side and said, ‘Coach, I think I’d rather shower with the girls today.’ ” <br><br> The first part is simple fear-mongering and distortion. You can be as offended as you like; ordinances cover conduct, not your subjective view. Moreover, at most your daughter would see a person in women’s clothing, perhaps washing her hands. Is this the end of Western civilization as we know it? But the second part of his comments were cruel and belittling, whatever one’s views of transgender rights may be. It reinforces the stereotype that religious conservatives are intolerant and, frankly, mean. <br><br> Newly announced presidential candidate George Pataki has been the only GOP contender to speak up on the topic. He said in an interview with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer: “We should give people their dignity and let them make their own decisions. People often make decisions that I don’t agree with but in a government where it’s supposed to be of the people, if someone chooses the path that’s different from mine, we should respect that as opposed to mocking it.” He then repeated that sentiment in a tweet. <br><br> I don’t think every GOP candidate needs to speak out on this — any more than I think it was necessary for every Republican to denounce Rudy Giuliani’s remarks about the president’s love of country. But if asked, candidates would be wise to distance themselves from Huckabee’s remarks and attitude. They need not play into the stereotype of the mean-spirited conservative. Truth be told, the perception that the GOP is not inclusive (be it on immigration, gay rights or other topics) hobbles the party’s appeal to a range of voters not limited to gays and minorities. Young people, urbanites, secular Americans, and yes, white and religious voters, don’t want to be seen as intolerant or cruel — and they don’t want to associate with candidates who are. <br><br> I would commend to them one of the loveliest stories about President George W. Bush: <br><br> At the White House in 2003, President George W. Bush hosted a celebratory 25th reunion for his Yale University classmates. When he graduated in 1968, Yale was an all-male school, but one of his college brothers had gotten a sex change and was now a woman. Standing on the receiving line, she debated how to introduce herself to the conservative president. The best she could come up with was: “You might remember me as Peter when we left Yale …” Without skipping a beat, Bush stepped in, “And now you’ve come back as yourself.” <br><br> It’s the sort of comment you hope you’d have the presence of mind to come up with instantaneously. Republicans should strive to follow that example of tolerance and grace, and not Huckabee’s crass conduct. The latter’s remarks were shameful, and he should have the decency to apologize. <br><br>";;09:30:41;2015-06-03;https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/04/16/Others/Images/2015-04-16/20150417-pataki-3101429216987.jpg;Former New York governor George Pataki and his wife, Libby, campaign in April at a Chipotle restaurant in Manchester, N.H.

9b617d262cc2904f20b63e5912b49c5d;Why Georgia looks more promising than Kentucky for Senate Democrats;"The Georgia Senate race is looking like a better pickup opportunity for Democrats than Kentucky, three weeks from Election Day. <br><br> The latest evidence: the advertising strategy of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. The DSCC will spend $1 million on ads down the stretch in Georgia, while it has gone dark in Kentucky, an official confirms. The moves were first reported Tuesday by Politico and Roll Call. <br><br> Republicans remain slight favorites in both states. But they appear to be moving in different directions. <br><br> The big story in Georgia the last couple of weeks has been GOP nominee David Perdue's remark in a 2005 deposition that he spent ""most"" of his career on outsourcing. Democratic nominee Michelle Nunn has pounced on the comment, airing two TV ads. <br><br> In Kentucky, Democratic nominee Alison Lundergan Grimes has attracted a lot of attention over her refusal to say whether she voted for President Obama, who is very unpopular in the state. Her silence has fueled Republican attacks and overshadowed other issues she would rather talk about. Meanwhile, McConnell has led in most recent polls. <br><br> Republicans need to gain six seats to win the Senate majority. They are also playing defense. <br><br> More worrisome for the GOP than either Georgia or Kentucky at this point is Kansas, where polls show a tight race between Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) and independent Greg Orman. Orman has not said which party caucus with in the Senate if the majority comes down to him. Our most recent Friday Line had Kansas as the likeliest of the three Republican-held seats to flip Democratic. <br><br> None of this is to say that any of these races are done deals. They aren't. But today, Nunn finds herself in a much better position than Grimes does. <br><br>";;13:01:19;2014-10-14;https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2014-10-07/AP/Georgia_Senate-00811.jpg;Michelle Nunn's political fortune seems to be looking up.

67140b4c96b86e80975758fc241d1397;The Democratic presidential debates are great news for Hillary Clinton;"Hillary Clinton got some much-needed good news on Tuesday when the Democratic National Committee announced that it would hold six presidential primary debates starting this fall. <br><br> What?! you say. How can it be a good thing for Clinton to be in a bunch of debates (okay, six) with candidates who will see these skirmishes as their best (and, really, only) chances of knocking her front-runner block off? <br><br> Sure, the debates will give every Bernie Sanders, Jim Webb and Martin O'Malley an equal-ish platform to Clinton that they could never afford -- literally -- otherwise. But, viewed broadly, the debates are likely to do Clinton more good than harm. <br><br> Remember that Clinton and her team want to make sure you and everyone else knows that she is not taking this nomination for granted -- despite the fact that the field running against her is not exactly the 1927 Yankees. <br><br> What better way to show that she is willing to fight for the every vote than to stand on a debate stage six times with the other candidates? That leveling process is a net good thing for Clinton in a way it wouldn't be for virtually any other candidate. While this would be seen as ""punching down"" for most well-known candidates, Clinton badly needs to avoid the appearance of a coronation, and a bunch of debates is a very good way to do that. <br><br> Then there is the fact that Clintonworld would like some positive media coverage during the primary and some credit for winning it. <br><br> Clinton is, if the 2008 campaign is any evidence, a skilled and poised debater who will likely perform well in the six showdowns to come. Her debate performances will then provide a storyline that isn't about her e-mail server, the Clinton Foundation or how much she or her husband were paid to give speeches. Clinton and her top aides abhor process stories, but a series of pieces about her ability and agility on the debate stage would be the sort of process-y story they would welcome with open arms. <br><br> Clinton also doesn't want the prevailing sentiment of the coverage, especially among Democratic voters, to be that she beat a bunch of nobodies and proved nothing in the process. An ideal Clinton primary win would be one in which she was challenged just enough to get credit for not just winning but for answering some of her critics in the process but not one so competitive that, well, she wasn't guaranteed victory. A series of debates lends credibility to Clinton's challengers that they might not be able to acquire otherwise. <br><br> Then there is the general election consideration. Clinton has not been an active candidate for anything since mid-2008. She is rusty -- as any candidate would be who hasn't run for anything in seven years. Carefully stage-managed conversations with average people in early primary and caucus states is not the same thing as a freewheeling debate when it comes to getting your game legs under you for the general election. Clinton's people might not ever admit it publicly, but she undoubtedly needs practice before the three highly watched and highly meaningful general election debates against the GOP nominee. These warm-up debates will give her just that. <br><br> Taken together, the debates are a very good thing for Clinton. They expose her to risk, sure, but the rewards for her campaign are far greater. <br><br>";;13:02:20;2015-05-05;https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/05/03/National-Politics/Images/470545852.jpg;Democratic presidential hopeful and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton speaks with students and faculty of New Hampshire Technical Institute, Concord Community College, on April 21, 2015, in Concord, New Hampshire.

37e92942182fe069ccabdaa92deb24a2;The deep sea is vast, unexplored, and incredibly important;Two hundred meters beneath the surface of the ocean, there exists an ecosystem of plants and animals that directly affect our day-to-day life on land. But you probably don’t know what the deep sea does for you. Researchers like Andrew Thurber of Oregon State University think that spells trouble. <br><br> Today in Biogeosciences, he and his colleagues have published a review of more than 200 studies on deep sea resources, giving us our first comprehensive look at what we gain—and steal—from the bottom of the ocean. <br><br> “There’s this idea in the public that we don’t know anything about the deep sea,” Thurber said. “That it’s overwhelmingly large and dark.” And it certainly is a bit mysterious: In the deep, plants no longer get their energy from sunlight, creating a host of creatures that seem strange compared to our usual marine fare. But by volume, 98.5 percent of the areas of the planet that can support animals are in the deep sea. <br><br> Despite all the unknown crevices, Thurber said, “we do know enough to start to understand how our actions in the deep sea can impact the environment.” These actions, he said, include mining for minerals and precious metals, as well as aggressive fishing. <br><br> And what do we have to lose? “For starters, a quarter to a half of the carbon dioxide we’ve put into the atmosphere has been absorbed by the deep sea,” Thurber said. And large reservoirs of methane are contained by the biological activity in the ecosystem as well. “It’s the deep sea that makes our planet habitable,” he said. <br><br> The mining of nickel from the deep sea poses an immediate concern, Thurber said. Countries with limited access to the metal on land are seeking it out by way of deep sea mining. “These metals build up over thousands of years,” he said, “but they can be mined incredibly rapidly.” He and his colleagues worry that these resources will be depleted before we understand how severe the impact on our environment will be. At that point, the ecosystem could take centuries to recover. <br><br> “We just want people to know that the deep sea impacts their day to day life,” Thurber said. “It lets them live as they do. And in the future, it will provide resources for their cellphones and cars. It’s an incredible resource that’s mostly untapped, which is very exciting.” But, he said, it’s important that those taking advantage of the deep sea’s treasures proceed with care. <br><br>;;08:00:38;2014-07-29;https://img.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp-content/uploads/sites/36/2014/07/img_0485.jpg;Gorgonocephalus caputmedusae, a sea star, was the first species ever recovered from the deep sea.
